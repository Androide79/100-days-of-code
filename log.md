### Day 2: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created my first external package in GO. Converted the main project into a GO module, used the external package created as a requirement. Implemented use of an environment file for configuration using the GO package [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper).

**Thoughts**: Finding time for the challenge was hard, but day three was like a goal...lol
